- 👋 Hi, I’m @eddydel03
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a software engineer or developer and I have passion of learning how to code. Also, what I am interested in learning in learning how to store information on databases. I would like to learn how to import and export information and develop data analytical skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java in my free time and also I am studying at a community college. When graduated I plan on transferring to a college or university to earn a bachelors degree for programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating my own projects on my own as a beginner. While I am learning more skills on how to code, I am also seeking internships to work for companies in their IT departmnets.
